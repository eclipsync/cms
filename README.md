Mantra Smartfren - Management Reporting Analisys [ 2015 - Aug 2023 ]

Mantra is Sales Reporting Tool for Smartfren Commercial Report Dashboard.
- 2015 Bu Happy and Rohmat create ETL database reports for collecting all requests from Pak Tom via DWH.
- Then Herwin create a website application for commercial teams and gallery with native php to provide some dashboard reporting from website called Mantra and produce some report tools called dragon eye.
- Last 2016, i join with sales reporting team and re-developing Mantra with php framework called laravel till early 2017 but before the web app done, dashboard reporting was handled by MIS so next i just create daily mail reporting view via native php with Iqbal who handle the ETL database.
- Last 2017, Mantra first lounching with new framework but development still in progress.
- In 2018, Mantra was re-develop again to provide some dashboard reports for some outlet programs and distributors with wordpress.
- In Aug 2022, i finish development process for Laravel Mantra, so this website re-develop again with my latest declarative code with laravel until Aug 2023 to provide some outlet programs and distributors report dashboard.
- Now [Mantra](https://mantra.smartfren.com) was shut down and the last result was cloned in my own [website](https://smartfren.incodiy.com)
